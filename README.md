### Tuts+ Tutorial: From PSD to HTML With the Skeleton Boilerplate
#### Instructor: Catalin Miron

In this series weâ€™ll be focusing on coding a PSD layout, using the responsive Skeleton boilerplate. There are plenty of tutorials on how to code a design using HTML and CSS, often with an extra dash of JavaScript, but the main purpose of this tutorial is to get things built using the latest version of the Skeleton framework (2.0.4). There have been some great improvements since we last covered it!
